# Architecture Of Record

This folder is intentionally outside the main app code flow.
It stores high-signal notes for major changes so a new session can ramp up quickly.

## How to use
- Add one entry to changes.md for each significant feature, refactor, or integration.
- Keep entries short and factual.
- Link to touched files and note risks/follow-ups.

## Entry template

Change: <short title>
Why: <problem/goal>
What changed:
- <key point>
Files:

Impact/Risks:
- <if any>
